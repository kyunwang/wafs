The course repo for 'Web App From Scratch' which has a duration of 3 weeks.

In parallel with the course [CSS To The Rescue](https://github.com/kyunwang/hva-css-minor)

Challenges:
- Use vanilla Javascript only
- Try to use CSS Grid as main layout tool
- Microlibs may be used for templating and routing
- Implement BEM CSS class naming

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/kyunwang/wafs.git`

2. Change directory to the app folder: `cd app`

3. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or if you use yarn `yarn`

4. And you are ready to go. The app will open up automatically.

## Features
- Browse Anime
- Browse Manga
- Search on users (To keep track of what you are watching yourself) - Basic
- Filter your user library on *all, currently watching, finished watching and plan to watch*
- See the users anime and manga


## The used API
This application makes use of the [Kitsu API](https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/).

**Citation from the docs**

> Kitsu is a modern anime discovery platform that helps you track the anime you're watching, discover new anime and socialize with other fans.With the Kitsu API you can do everything the client can do and much more.API path: https://kitsu.io/api/edge


It was really easy to get basic `GET` requests but a lot of the documentation as unclear. Like how to make `POST` requests, as the required header and data has not been documented. The time taken to understand and implemment the API could have been much less if it had been beter documentated or more varied exampled were given.

At the time of using the API authorization was also not possible (At the time of writing a *Password grant has been documented*).


## Packages
The packages used are:
- [Routie](https://github.com/jgallen23/routie) for routing
- [Transparency](http://leonidas.github.io/transparency/) for templating

These packages are ok for small applications but not suitable for anything bigger than that.

Had to include `babel-polyfil` because the compiled code wouldn't work otherwise.

### Routing - Routie
A really simple hash router.
It does the job as a super simple light-weight router. A caveat is that internal linking can happen because of the hash linking. (The jumping to id's).


**Citation from the docs**
> Routie is a javascript hash routing library. It is designed for scenarios when push state is not an option (IE8 support, static/Github pages, Phonegap, simple sites, etc). It is very tiny (800 bytes gzipped), and should be able to handle all your routing needs.

Development seems to be stopped since July 2016

### Templating - Transparency
Feels really cluttered and inefficient because the templated have to be declared in the (index)html. It sadly cannot be declared elsewhere and be imported as components.

It was really abstract at the start and I needed time to get used to the way it works.

Documentation can't be said to be clear, but the it certainly helps, especially the examples.

Unlike `Pug`, `Transparancy` does render dynamically.

**Citation from the docs**
> Transparency is a semantic template engine for the browser. It maps JSON objects to DOM elements by id, class and data-bind attributes.

Development seems to be stopped since September 2015


## Actor and Flow diagram
These diagrams give a overview of the available methods and how the (data)flow goes of the application.

The flow diagrams are made with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io)

### Actor diagram
The actor diagram shows all our *Actors* to give a clear overview of where all the possible methods and properties live and are called.

### Flow diagram
These diagrams show a the data flow of the application. In this case it has been divided in three sections.

- **The initial flow**

Initializing the application

- **The flow on the overview page**

## Todo
- [x] ~~Clean the templates because I was pretty WET, but want to be DRY (You get it? üòè)~~
- [x] ~~Add pagination~~
- [ ] Some more info on the initial library view
	- Added a example in the placeholder for now
- [x] ~~Transpile the JS to ES5~~
- [ ] Show the loader on pagination

## Known issues
Mostly just small issues
- [ ] Not all api failures have been catched yet
- [ ] Pagination in a filtered view does not work correctly yet. (e.g. after selecting *completed* in the user library)
- [x] ~~Does not work on most browser (because of ES6 spread operator) - Transpile to ES5~~
- Some styling (the buttons) is not consistent across browsers (safari, windows chrome) 
- [ ] The detailpage is not really *done/made*
- [ ] The pagination should't have animation
- [ ] Pagination didn't work on safari ()
- [x] ~~Pagination runs on detailpage~~

## Wishlist
- [ ] The ability to login/create a account
- [ ] The ability to update your entries
- [ ] More options in the anime/manga overview for better browsing


## Future plan
Recreate a similar app but with a **React** or **Vue** and a different API. Preferably one which keeps itself synced with MyAnimeList
