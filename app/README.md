Challenges:
- Use vanilla Javascript only
- Try to use CSS Grid as main layout tool
- Microlibs may be used for templating and routing
- BEM naming

## Microlibs used

### Routing - Routie
*Put link to routie here*

### Templating - Transparency

// short
Really abstract and needed time get used to the way it works
Needed to be dynamic so template engines like `Pug` won't cut it

Documentation can't be said to be clear, but the it certainly helps, especially the examples.

*Should I use `template literals` for for custom templates instead?*
Maybe

### Need to do
- Clean the templates because I was pretty WET, but want to be DRY (You get it? 😏)
